Hi, my name is Kuba, and I am a 3rd-year computer engineering student. Currently, I am learning Kotlin and Spring Boot, and I am looking for an internship in either Android or Java development.

Here is some descriptions of the most important projecsts:

Quiz App (Visible on my account)  
Quiz App is a group semester project. It is a web application that allows teachers to create quizzes for students and students to solve these quizzes. The main technologies that we worked with are Java and Spring Boot. We also used Bootstrap Studio for generating HTML templates and Thymeleaf for connecting everything. The app is capable of getting user input, sending it over to the server, and after computations on the server side, sending a response back to the user.

Reminder App (Visible on my account)  
This app is entirely made by myself. I wanted to make my version of a reminder app. It uses the Room library to work with a database. I also used Kotlin coroutines for threading and fragments for UI design. I attempted to make a widget that would be responsive to the changes in the database and would use it to load the data. Unfortunately, after a few attempts, I gave up on this idea but I left all the code to show my thinking process.

Mafia game (https://github.com/JavaPK2022/mafia)  
This is also a group semester project. At this point, the game is still in development, but most of its most important components are done. The point of the game is to find out who the mafia is and vote them out, and for the mafia to eliminate the players before they get voted out. The focus in this project was on learning how to use threading mechanisms, UDP, and TCP in Java. Every player can communicate with the server using either UDP or TCP (depending on what they want from the server). The communication uses a lot of threading and safety mechanisms to prevent threading errors.
